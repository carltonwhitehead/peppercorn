# Peppercorn

A sweet library for parsing and querying sour st1 files

## Status

Peppercorn is under development. File and Line classes with nearly 100% unit test code coverage are merged into master. You can use these classes to read a .st1 file and get the individual values of each line on a line-by-line basis.

## Roadmap

The next feature will be query tools to cover these use cases:

- Query all runs of a given driver
- Query the fastest runs of each driver in a given category, sorted by RAW or PAX time
- Query the fastest runs of every driver sorted by RAW or PAX time
- Query only one run of a given driver
